# NENO ![Build](https://github.com/SebastianZimmer/neno/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

## What is NENO?

NENO is a powerful note-taking app that helps you create your personal knowledge graph. With NENO, you retain full control over your data because you decide where it is stored: On your device or on a cloud storage of your choice.
