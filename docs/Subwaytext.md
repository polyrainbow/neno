# Subwaytext

Subwaytext is a simple block-based plain-text markup format based on [Subtext](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/subtext). It works very similar to subtext with some adjustments:

- Text blocks can be multiline, they go on until two line breaks occur
- Code blocks: use three backticks (```) on the lines before and after the code block
- Quote blocks are not supported yet
