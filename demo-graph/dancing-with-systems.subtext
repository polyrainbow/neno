# Dancing with systems

> You can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting system cannot be governed by a static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain [[feedback loops]], but meta-feedback loops–loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process.
