A [[complex system]] is both highly differentiated and highly integrated
> If I'm highly differentiated, I can do many different things. But if I do many different things and Iâ€™m not highly integrated, I will fly apart as a system. So I need to be both highly differentiated, so I can do many different things, and highly integrated, so I stay together as an integrated system. As systems complexify, they self-transcend, they go through qualitative development. - [[John Vervaeke - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis]] Ep. 31
